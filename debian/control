Description: Collection of shell functions commonly used in scripts
 This is a collection of shell functions commonly used in scripts, like
 checking if the script is run as root, ensuring that only one instance is
 running at the same time, print some messages only in verbose mode, or
 trapping the most common signals to exit carefully in case something goes
 wrong.
