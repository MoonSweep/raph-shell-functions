[\fB-e\fR \fIEMAIL_ADDRESS\fR] \fISCRIPT-NAME\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBcreate-raph-shell-script\fR is a program to automatically create a shell
script stub (and its associated manpages), which uses the
\fBraph-shell-functions\fR shell library.

.SH OPTIONS

Your full name.

.TP
.BR \-h
Show summary of options.

.SH FILES
A system-wide \fI/etc/create-raph-shell-script.conf\fR and a per-user
\fI~/.create-raph-shell-script.conf\fR are parsed to set default variables. See
the \fBcreate-raph-shell-script.conf\fR(5) manpage for details.

.SH NOTES
\fBcreate-raph-shell-script\fR will abort if a file it tries to create already exists.

.SH EXAMPLE
Create a script called \fBfoo\fR in /tmp, with John Doe as a name and jdoe@bar.com as e-mail address:
.PP
.RS
create-raph-shell-script -f "John Doe" -e jdoe@bar.com /tmp/foo
.RE
.PP
This will create three files: a shell script stub in \fI/tmp/foo\fR, a manpage
stub for the script in \fI/tmp/foo.1\fR, and a manpage stub for a config file
in \fI/tmp/foo.conf.5\fR.
